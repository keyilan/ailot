# Ailot Mobile Dictionary
Ailot is a React Native based dictionary framework for the preservation of minority languages. This is part of the Phonemica dictionary project presented at the Language Documentation Tools Summit at the University of Melbourne on 1-3 June 2016.

The goal of the Ailot dictionary project is to provide a free and easy to use tool to allow linguists and community members to create mobile phone dictionaries for under-served languages. The project is being deleveloped in React Native to provide cross-platform compatibility.

Currently we are testing two verisons of the app, one for [Tai Ahom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahom_language) and one for [Tai Phake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai_Phake_language). Afterfurther testing of the app itself and the [Toolbox converter](https://github.com/phonemica/ailot_converter), we will start testing with other languages. Since each language variety has its own unique set of demands, it's worth testing over a wide range to work out what problems may come up.

For an example, see our [Jingpo dictionary app](https://github.com/phonemica/jingpo/).
