# Ailot Mobile Dictionary
A React Native dictionary framework for the preservation of minority languages. This is part of the Phonemica dictionary project presented at the Language Documentation Tools Summit at the University of Melbourne on 1-3 June 2016.

The version of the dictionary being hosted here is based on the Tai Ahom manuscripts. This is a re-working of an earlier version of the project, and is a work in-progress.

# Dependencies
In its current form the Ailot Dictionary requires `oblador/react-native-vector-icons` and `xxsnakerxx/react-native-ya-navigator`.
